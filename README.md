## Overview

Getting funding is often the most difficult part of getting a product or business idea off the ground. Kickstarter has been a momentous part of helping many ideas get the funding they require, but it can be tough to know if you will reach your goal. Our app aims to give a prediction on whether or not you will reach your target goal by your deadline.

## Description

Our app currently holds nine features which you can enter regarding your specific Kickstarter campaign, and we hope to keep updating to include more! Your responses will be ran through a model trained and tested on 300,000+ previous kickstarter campaigns, the model will then output a prediction on whether or not it belives the campaign will be a success.
